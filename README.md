**BoltOn** is an open source application framework which can be used to build any type of .NET applications like Console, MVC, WebAPI, Windows Service etc., with [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) being the crux of it. Though it doesn't have all the components to call it as an enterprise application framework (EAF) currently, the plan is to make it an EAF eventually. The components are written in such a way that they're modular, thus they can be easily bolted on with other components and replaced, and hence the name Bolt-On. 

Please go over the [Documentation](https://gokulm.github.io/BoltOn/) to know more about the framework.
