[**BoltOn**](https://github.com/gokulm/BoltOn) is an open source application framework which can be used to build any type of .NET applications like Console, MVC, WebAPI, Windows Service etc. The components are written in such a way that they're [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), thus they can be bolted on with other components and interchanged easily, and hence the name Bolt-On. 

Please go over the [Documentation](https://gokulm.github.io/BoltOn/) to know more about the framework.
